### Description

Happy99 is a worm and virus for Microsoft Windows and considered to be the first worm to spread using e-mail attachments. It also attached itself to all newsgroup posts a user made in usenet.

> This virus modifies wsock32.dll, so that when an email is sent, a second message containing the virus is sent also.
>
> [...]
>
> The virus also copies the original wsock32.dll to wsock32.ska. It creates the file liste.ska which is a list of the mail addresses to which Happy99.exe is sent. It uses liste.ska to ensure that it mails Happy99.exe to each address only once.
>
> When triggered W32/Ska-Happy99 displays a fireworks effect with the message "Happy New Year 1999". [^1]

Happy99 needs port 119 to be able to send mail. In case this fails, it will automatically switch to port 25. [^3]
