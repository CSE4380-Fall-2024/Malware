### Description

ESEA is a subscription service for the games League of Legends, Counterstrike: Source, 
Counterstrike: 1.6, Counterstrike: Global Offensive as well as Team Fortress 2.
Their launcher provides the user with a cheating detection system and is therefore granted
extensive permissions. [^1]

In April 2013, players started posting in forums about increased GPU usage[^2] as well as Antivirus
software flagging the ESEA launcher.

ESEA's first responded by claiming that the software had been running for just one day 
and that roughly 280$ worth of BTC had been mined, and that the miner had been enabled
on accident due to an erroneous server restart. [^3]

This statement was later amended, stating that around 3,700$ worth of BTC had been mined
and that the miner had been enabled by a malicious rogue employee. The company claims that 
they had been talking internally about the idea of a miner and had been considering implementing
it as part of an April fool's joke. However, after implementing it and trying it on their 
own accounts, they decided to not further pursue the idea, claiming that it was "not worth the drama." [^4]

ESEA donated the entirety of the profits made from the miner to the American Cancer foundation.
Additionally, the state of New Jersey ordered ESEA to pay a 1m$ fine, of which 675.000$ would
be waived if the company kept a "clean record" for the next ten years. [^5]
Additionally, the employee who enabled the miner on player's PCs was fired.
