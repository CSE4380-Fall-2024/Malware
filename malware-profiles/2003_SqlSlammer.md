### Description
> The SQL Slammer is a computer worm that caused a DoS on some Internet hosts and dramatically
> slowed down general Internet traffic, starting at 05:30 UTC on January 25, 2003. It spread
> rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within 10 minutes, making it the fastest-spreading
> worm of its time - despite the fixing patch being available 6 months pre. 
> Although titled "SQL Slammer", the program did not use the SQL language; it exploited two buffer
> overflow bugs in Microsoft's flagship SQL Server database product via 376 Bytes UDP-packets to 
> port 1434 (SQL Server Resolution Service). Other names include W32.SQLExp.Worm, DDOS.SQLP1434.A,
> Sapphire Worm, SQL_HEL, and W32/SQLSlammer.
> 
>
> Continental Airlines resorted to pens and paper to record reservations and tickets. The airline
> had to delay and cancel some flights, though no delays lasted more than 30 minutes.
> 
> Banks in the US and Canada were hard hit. A majority of Bank of America's ATMs were rendered
> useless and while most were running by the evening, some customers reported being unable to use
> them well into the next day. Washington Mutual's ATMs and other bank services were unavailable
> for most of the day. Customers of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto were unable
> to withdraw money using ATMs. 
>
> The U.S. departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce and Defense
> were infected with the worm. The Emergency 911 network was down for some time. South Korea was
> particularly hard hit by the worm. Some of the Korean media claimed that the entire Internet
> infrastructure was knocked out and that billions of Won were lost. Customers of the ISP KT
> Freetel Corp and SK Telecom lost their internet connections. In Portugal, more than 300,000
> customers of Cable ISP Netcabo lost internet access. \[cf. [^3], [^4]\]
