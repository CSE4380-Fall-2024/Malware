### Description

> The Storm Worm is a Trojan horse program. Its payload is another program, though not always the same one. Some versions of the Storm Worm 
turn computers into zombies or bots. As computers become infected, they become vulnerable to remote control by the person behind the attack. 
Some hackers use the Storm Worm to create a botnet and use it to send spam mail across the Internet. [^3]

> Many versions of the Storm Worm fool the victim into downloading the application through fake links to news stories or videos. The people 
behind the attacks will often change the subject of the e-mail to reflect current events. For example, just before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, 
a new version of the worm appeared in e-mails with subjects like "a new deadly catastrophe in China" or "China's most deadly earthquake." 
The e-mail claimed to link to video and news stories related to the subject, but in reality clicking on the link activated a download of the 
worm to the victim's computer. [^3]

> Several news agencies and blogs named the Storm Worm one of the worst virus attacks in years. By July 2007, an official with the security 
company Postini claimed that the firm detected more than 200 million e-mails carrying links to the Storm Worm during an attack that spanned 
several days. Fortunately, not every e-mail led to someone downloading the worm. [^3]

> Worms like Storm are written by hackers looking for profit, and they're different. These worms spread more subtly, without making noise. 
Symptoms don't appear immediately, and an infected computer can sit dormant for a long time. If it were a disease, it would be more like 
syphilis, whose symptoms may be mild or disappear altogether, but which will eventually come back years later and eat your brain. [^5]

> Rather than having all hosts communicate to a central server or set of servers, Storm uses a peer-to-peer network for C2. This makes the 
Storm botnet much harder to disable. The most common way to disable a botnet is to shut down the centralized control point. Storm doesn't 
have a centralized control point, and thus can't be shut down that way.
This technique has other advantages, too. Companies that monitor net activity can detect traffic anomalies with a centralized C2 point, but 
distributed C2 doesn't show up as a spike. Communications are much harder to detect.
One standard method of tracking root C2 servers is to put an infected host through a memory debugger and figure out where its orders are 
coming from. This won't work with Storm: An infected host may only know about a small fraction of infected hosts -- 25-30 at a time -- and 
those hosts are an unknown number of hops away from the primary C2 servers. 
And even if a C2 node is taken down, the system doesn't suffer. Like a hydra with many heads, Storm's C2 structure is distributed. [^5]
