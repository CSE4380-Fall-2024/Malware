### Description

> In 1988 the first known worm was developed by the computer science student Robert T. Morris. Originally designed to count computers, a bug led to a fast spreading of the worm, causing huge damage due to system overloads and crashes over several months.\[[^1]\]
>
> The program was divided into two parts: The first part called grappling hook tried to get on the targeted device, just to uploud the worm there. This was achieved by requesting the worm from the already infected computer. The worm itself then started to identify and infect new target systems using one of four different methods.
The first method called FINGERD used a special function from the standard C-library which didn't check the length of it's parameters inside the FINGER-daemon. Providing a special string caused a buffer overflow, resulting in an overriding of the return adress, thereby opening a new shell with the rights of the daemon. The transfer and execution of the worm were then accomplished using the shell. While the vulnerability was known for quite a time, many devices hadn't been fixed.
The second method called SENDMAIL used versions of a mail daemon which were compiled using the debug option, resulting in an active backdoor for developers. This backdoor could be used to start a shell. This vulnerability was known for a long time as well.
The third method called RSH used the concept of distributed trust on UNIX-systems. Since distributed trust was often used in a two-way manner, the worm tried to start a remote-shell on the trusted devices registered on the local computer.
The last method included a brute-force-attack on the local account to get the correct passwords. If the user had been using the same passwords on other devices in the network the worm could start a new remote-shell.\[[^1]\]
>
> The worm was supposed to spread itself in only 1 of 15 cases, but a bug lead to a infection of new devices in 14 of 15 cases, causing many computers to crash. Without this mistake it would probably have taken much longer to detect the worm.
As a consequence Robert was expelled from his university and the first person ever to be convicted under ther Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\[[^1]\]
