### Description

>The spread of NotPetya started the 27th June 2017 from an ukrainian developer of tax and accounting software using their updating mechanism to distribute the malware. [[^1]]

>NotPetya, resembling the ransomware Petya from 2016, used the previously leaked exploit tool EternalBlue in Microsoft Systems and Mimikatz, a program able to retrieve windows passwords from RAM. The worm infected computers without the necessary patch against the EternalBlue vulnerability which had been released by Microsoft before NotPetyas launch. Using passwords gained from infected computers, NotPetya could even attack patched systems. After only hours, NotPetya had already spread worldwide.[[^4]]

>Eventhough blackmail demands were raised by the software, NotPetya encrypted the "master boot records" without possibility to decrypt them. [[^4]] 
Thus NotPetya was rather a destructive "wiper" than a ransomware. [[^5]]

> Computer scientists discovered a possibility to immunize the computer against the malware by creating a file named "perfc" in the "C:\Windows" folder. However the immune computer will still infect others. [[^6]]
