### Description

> Necurs is a modular botnet with a lot of features targeting win32-hosts, but it is mainly known for sending large spam campaigns through email. It is used to distribute other Malware by mail.
> Necurcs injects payloads into the running process to detect virtualized environments. Necurs also includes a kernel rootkit.
>
> Like most other malware it uses encrypted communication within the botnet. It uses a binary format to send information to other components making it more difficult to analyze.
> When a system is infected by Necurs it disables all firewalls and rules for itself.
>
> Necurs can be upgraded by new modules in the form of DLLs which can be downloaded via the internet.
>
> In March 2020 Microsoft was able to predict the Domains of the hosts for the coming 25 months. These were blocked and thereby the Necrus botnet was set out of action.
