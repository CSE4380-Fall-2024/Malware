### Description

The CovidLock is a Ransomware that is infecting Android Users. It is distributed via an App that you need to install. If installed and granted administrativ permission, it procedes to lock you out of your device and prompts to send 100$ woth of Bitcoin to a Bitcoinwallet. \[[^1],[^3]\]

CovidLock tries to convince you to activate the device administrative acces by telling you, that it needs these permissions to monitor covid patients and infections nearby. \[[^3]\] 
This is a pretty smart move, as it seems to be a legitimite reason for the permissions. Also the prompt uses the fear of the target against a covid infection to its advantage.

When the payment is made an e-mail with the corrisponding transaction id should be send to an address in russia. The attaker says to respond with the unlock code needed to decrypt the phone. Luckily the code has ben reverse engineered by the team at domaintools and is now publicily available. \[[^3]\]

In the first days the website contained an iframe sourcing from infection2020.com, a trustworthy website for tracking US-based Covid-19 news. Additionally it showed a banner at the top of the site to encourage users to install the infected app to get real-time news about Covid-19. With this design they acted like an existing trustworthy website for informations about the crisis.

The design was changed a few days later to resources of another trustworthy provider of several applications, DoMobile. But the malicious "Coronatracker" is still offered. \[[^3]\]
