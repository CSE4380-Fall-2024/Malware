### Description

>SOBIG.F is a computer worm discovered on 18 August 2003 that spread to computers running the Microsoft Windows 
>operating system. [[^2],[^3]]

>SOBIG.F was probably released via a pornographic newsgroup. Sobig.F is characterised as a network-active mass-mailing 
>worm that sends itself to all email addresses found in files with extensions .dbx, .eml, .hlp, .htm, .html, .mht, 
>.wab or .txt. [[^2],[^4]]

>When the Sobig.F worm is activated, it copies itself to the Windows directory named WINPPR32.EXE and places a 
>configuration file named WINSTT32.DAT in the same directory. [[^2]]

>The worm opens ports to the Internet on infected computers, installs its own mail server and constantly sends 
>infected emails to any recipient. [[^2],[^3],[^4],[^5]]

>The worm is programmed to contact specific computers every Friday and Sunday until 10 September 2003 to receive small 
>updates in the form of further instructions. This involves sending a UDP packet to port 8998 of a remote server. 
>These targeted computers were taken off the network after a short time due to the determined IP addresses.[[^2]]

>Potentially all Microsoft operating system versions from Windows 95 to Windows XP without corresponding hotfixes 
>were infected by Sobig.F.[[^2],[^6]]
