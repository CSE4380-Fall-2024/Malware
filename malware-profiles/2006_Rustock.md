### Description

>The Rustock botnet is known as a computer Trojan horse infection that gains control over an infected system. The IP addresses of many of these infected computers are included on a IP blacklist, which is how security researchers are able to trace some of their activities. Once a system is infected with Rustock, it may be unable to perform certain normal functions and later controlled by a remote source to carry out illegal functions.
>
>Rustock botnet, at one time, was able to send spam messages using a TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is a type of encryption protocol used to send secure email messages, to avoid detection or inspection by network equipment. Usually, network systems have filters in addition to software that will detect and block emails identified as spam. Rustock was able to virtually bypass these filters which may have been a contributing factor to why it is responsible for about 40% of the world's spam messages. \[[^5]\]


Information about takedown. 
>On Friday, the truth about this latest drop in Rustock activity emerged: the silencing of the botnet was the result of Operation b107, a Microsoft-led anti-botnet action. In a coordinated legal and technical attack on the botnet, US Marshals seized command and control servers from seven US cities (Kansas City, Scranton, Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Seattle, and Columbus), with two more servers seized overseas, and network providers cut off access to ranges of IP addresses used to control the network.
>
>The result was that the hundreds of thousands of machines in the network were left with no source of instructions: no spams to send, no distributed denial-of-service attacks to perform, no new malware to distribute. The botnet's activity has dropped to zero. \[[^1]\]
