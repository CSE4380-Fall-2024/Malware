### Description

MyDoom is a worm that infects Microsoft Systems. It is primary distributed via E-Mail and appears as a transmission error.  It becomes the fastest spreading email worm ever (until 2004)
> With subject lines including "Error", "Mail Delivery System" or "Mail Transaction Failed" in different languages[^1].  

> When Mydoom is executed, it copies itself to the Windows system folder as Taskmon.exe [...]. It also creates the file Shimgapi.dll in the system folder. This file is a backdoor trojan that opens TCP listening ports ranging from 3127 to 3198 and can download and execute arbitrary files. [...].
The worm creates or modifies several registry keys. [...]This ensure that the worm will run every time the computer is started. [...] It also ensures shimgapi.dll will be run by Internet Explorer when the web browser is run.[^2]

The worm sends itself as an email using its own SMTP engine.
